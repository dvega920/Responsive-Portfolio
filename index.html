        <p>
            My name is David Vega and I am 38 years old. I live in Haverhill, MA with my fiance Adam and our dog
            Cooper. I am a Contracts Administrator for an energy company based in Calgary. I am looking to
            supplement my Associate Degree in Information Technology with some web development. I have been
            practicing html, css and javascript for approximately three (3) years.
            My decision to go to a bootcamp was due in part because I needed some consistency with coding. My job
            is very demanding and it is very easy to put practicing aside when there is no real incentive or some
            level of accountability.
            I am currently taking on small personal projects to further develop my skills. I am assisting my
            sister with her website for her small business down in Florida where she is a Licensed Medical Esthetician
            providing skin care products and services in the Apollo Beach area
